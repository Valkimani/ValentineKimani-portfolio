# Description

This is a Responsive design project. Screenshots were provided as a reference, The task is to ensure that all web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

##

To achieve this, Bootstrap CSS Framework has been used to create a mobile responsive portfolio using the following:
as stated below.

- I created `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` files to build the code in.
- Added a navbar to the header to accomodate html links. When reduced, the nav bar reduces with the screen while acccomodating the links.
- To achievce the responseive layout, media quesrries were used as well as the bootstrap grid system (containers, rows, and columns) .
- Width and display properties were used to make the images more responsive.

# To validate the code was working a per the refernec provided,

- An HTML validation service was used to ensure that each page has valid HTML.
- When the screen size is adjusted, content on an `xs` screen takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens has some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
- When the links are clicked, the load the responsive pages.
- Semantic elements like <nav></nav> were used to replace div elements.
